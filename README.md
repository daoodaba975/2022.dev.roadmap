# 2022 Dev Roadmap

My development roadmap for year `2022` 🚀  
The objective is to gain new skills and develop my expertise on technologies that I already master.

_I will continually update this repo._

## Improve my skills with Flutter 🐦

The year before, I discovered Flutter, it was one of my great discoveries, I learned a lot.  
Now, I would like to continue this momentum by developing applications from A to Z for personal projects by fully pushing the functionality that Flutter offers.

## Learn Svelte 💫

Learning Svelte was one of my unfulfilled goals in 2021.  
That's why I'm starting early this year so as not to miss the opportunity yet 😇
